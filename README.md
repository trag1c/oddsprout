# oddsprout

Oddsprout is a configurable CLI tool and a Python library for generating random JSONs
with no schemas involved. I made it because I needed to generate some JSONs but all
solutions I found online involved generating data based on templates.

See the [documentation] for usage.

## Installation
If you only intend to use it as a CLI tool:
```sh
pipx install oddsprout
```

---

Otherwise, install the library from PyPI:
```sh
pip install oddsprout
```
Or from source:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/trag1c/oddsprout.git
```
